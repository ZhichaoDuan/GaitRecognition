# Gait-Recognition-Research

## Test Environment
This repo works fine on a four NVIDIA 2080Ti machine. All the packages and their versions have been exported to [this file](environment.yaml) using

```
conda env export > environment.yaml
```

And you can recreate a exact the same environment by 

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
